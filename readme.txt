Summary of findings

- the main finding in my analysis is that the number of female users is very low
 in comparison with male users so I investigated more and found that average trip for 
 females is longer than that of males and I used plots of the gender to other variables
 in my analysis.
- I found that number of shared trips is only less than 10%
so the company should encourage the shared trips more.

Key insights of the presenation
- I want to show that the number of females users is very low in my presentation
- I want also to show that Females uses the bikes longer than males
- I will recommend to make more investigation on what decreases the number of females 
 users is it the application or more advertisment needed in the females communities
